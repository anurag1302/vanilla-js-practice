## Primitive & Non Primitive Data Types ##
### Strings, Numbers, Booleans, null, undefined are primitive data types ###
### Objects, Arrays, Functions are non-primitive data types,these are collectively known as Objects ###
### Primitive data types are stored by value, while non primitive ones are stored by reference ###

## Null & Undefined ##
### Null is something which the developer sets ###
### null is an assignment value. ###
### It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value ###
### Undefined refers to something whose value is not found by JavaScript ###
### undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value,or even a variable hasn't been defined at all ###
### Ex: 1) variable without value 2) missing function parameters 3) missing object properties ###
### typeof null is object - its an error in the original javascript implementation ###
